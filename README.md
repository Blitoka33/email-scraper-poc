# This is a PoC
This python script works, however there are still lot of things that can be implemented into it, like more ways to find email addresses, however most of the emails should already be found.

# Contribution
Feel free to contribute if you want to, I will review pull requests constantly. You can fix small bugs, add more functions, anything!

# Setting it up
You need to have python. The recommended version is Python 3.10.9

You need to run the following commands in your command prompt. These commands are commands to install Python packages through pip:
```
pip install requests
```
```
pip install BeautifulSoup
```

After you've done that, try how the tool works. 
Run the application with the following command:
```
python main.py
```
OR if that doesn't work
```
python3 main.py
```

If you have issues feel free to open an issue about it in Github.
